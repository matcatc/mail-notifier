Introduction
------------

This is a simple script which monitors the current number of unread mail in
order to determine whether a new one has arrived.

I found this to be necessary because some IMAP servers would report new mail as
simple unread. Perhaps its an issue with my mail client (claws-mail), but
either way, its something I want to fix.

Since the script started as simple something to scratch an itch, don't expect
to be completely fully featured for every conceivable (or many) scenarios. But
the skeleton is there, so it should be easy to adjust it to your needs. You can
always contact me
