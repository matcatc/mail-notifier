This is a simple script which monitors the current number of unread mail in
order to determine whether a new one has arrived.

I found this to be necessary b/c some IMAP servers would report new mail as
simple unread. Perhaps its an issue with my mail client (claws-mail), but
either way, its something I want to fix.
